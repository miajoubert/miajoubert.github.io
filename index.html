						<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After working in tech support for 8 years, I began to notice that my favorite days were
						when I came across a new problem. No longer satisfied with "solving" the same problems
						over and over, I pursued software engineering to fulfill my desire for daily challenges.
					</p>
					<p>Outside of work, you can find me reading fiction of all sorts, bending over a new puzzle
						on my kitchen counter, breezing through Sudokus, getting annoyed at the New York Times
						Crossword puzzles, or hiking trails across Wisconsin.

						<h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>There was a distinct moment in my life when I realized that being a programmer was
						undeniably “cool.” While in the middle of playing Bot when I was about seven, I thought
						I had broken the computer when the game crashed. My father, who was a computer programmer,
						came to my rescue, and to my young eyes it seemed that his encoded instructions running
						through the computer was likely magic. The love I carried for understanding technology
						came to the surface as I started my first job out of college, ultimately leading me to
						an eight-year career in IT support. Nevertheless, I eventually ran out of daily challenges
						or sufficient problems to solve, instead applying the same solutions to similar problems
						on repeat. My unfulfillment illuminated my path toward becoming a programmer, giving me
						the opportunities to face new challenges each day and to apply my already-strong
						troubleshooting skills to debug code errors.
					</p>
					<p>My journey to becoming a developer culminated in a 24-week program, during which I spent
						over 1000 hours strengthening my knowledge in Javascript, Python, React/Redux, HTML, CSS,
						and multiple relational database language formats. Over that time, I had the opportunity
						to work in an Agile environment with SCRUM methods and version control through GitHub,
						building four complete full-stack applications in four separate one- and two-week sprints.
						In the process, I completed a functional clone of the task-management application,
						Todoist, perfectly replicating their styling formats. I encourage you to check out my
						quick growth and strong abilities throughout my projects in the portfolio link above.
					</p>
					<p>
						As exemplified in my six-month boot camp, learning new technologies and picking up
						new coding languages comes naturally for me. While the program was certainly challenging
						at times, I finally feel fully engaged in a perfectly demanding field, sharpening my
						technical abilities and satisfying my desire to continue solving new puzzles. My six
						years of tech support for Northwestern Mutual, along with my
						two years as a life underwriter, can bring a unique and undeniably valuable perspective
						to my role as a developer. I am certain that I would be a strong asset to your team,
						helping to build the software solutions for the company’s digital needs.
